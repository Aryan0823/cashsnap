previes changes are wrong and old, 
now i will assist you for new ones
now see,
i want the sum of all cashin->amount to be display
but the catch is that 
you have to fatch the data based on the year, month (this are dropdown list)
(month and year are have to take current like todays date is 2024-05-12
then 2024 is the year and 05 is the month date format is:YYYY-MM-DD in db).
user must have to select either of them year or month


so the structure of data stored in db is like 
Cashin is document which contain multiple collections and this collections are name based on the dates(like this:  2024-05-12, 2024-06-04,etc (date))
and all this collections/dates contain documents and this documents are named based on time like 0:50:49, etc (24 hr format) and this documents contain fields like
for example:

Amount: 9
Date: 2024-05-12
Time: 0:50:49
TransectionType: Cashin

Amount: 20
Date: 2024-05-12
Time: 2:37:20
TransectionType: Cashin

(note: all this values of Date,Time,Amount,TransectionType are just for example perpose) 

now for example
for example now when your select month 
so you have to fatch the all the data of current month(in this case current month is 05)
and you have to add every documents (name based on time) all the values of Amount and make total of them and display on this tag
<h5 id="cashInTotal">â‚¹ 0</h5>

i think i have clear all the thigs
